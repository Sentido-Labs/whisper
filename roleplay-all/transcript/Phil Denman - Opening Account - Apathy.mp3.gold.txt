Good afternoon Hall and Wood Finance Phil speaking Hi there I've just waited for 15 minutes on your phone line by the way Yeah Sorry we are experiencing quite a high number of calls at the moment So that is why you've had the long wait time Like 15 minutes is a very long time That's quite average What you're saying 15 minutes is an average call waiting time for your company For most companies about 15 minutes is about average I don't care You shouldn't have to wait fifteen minutes to talk to somebody Anyway moving on I want to open an account Unfortunately I can't actually open an account for you on the phone you would have to go into a branch to do that What Yeah that's how it's basically because we have to be to see your identification and obviously I can't I can't send it to you in it I mean what day and age is this I can't I can upload a photo to you guys Well I wouldn't be able to see your identification through the phone so I could do online We currently don't have that as an option The only option to open an account That's absolutely ridiculous You call yourself That's absolutely ridiculous I'm sorry you feel that way but that is the way the process is at the moment So I have to go into a branch The whole reason I'm calling you guys is because the queues in the brunch are far too long at the moment I've just literally popped in there's It'll probably be another half an hour before I even get to somebody there So I have to go back in there you're saying Yes Well I just think that's absolutely absurd I That is absolutely absolutely absurd I just think it's awful service I'm offering you my business here And do you know what forget it forget it It's fine goodbye OK Bye
