One would finance her speaking Good afternoon I would like to change my address I've recently moved and I can't find where to do this on the website Yeah you can't do it on the website Unfortunately you can only do it in the branch Sorry So I have to go into a branch to actually change my address Yes That seems a bit unnecessary Is there no way to do it online I don't drive and the local branch is quite far away and I simply have no time this week to do this There's no other option apart from from going in person Unfortunately no there's there's not an option to do it online And the reason you can't do it over the phone is because we have to see your ID which is why you have to go into the branch Is there no way to take a photo and put it online It seems very unnecessary to drive all the way you know especially with the computer nowadays just to take a photo and And send it in Yeah Yeah As I said unfortunately that's not something that we offer So if you want to change the address the only way you can do that is by going into the branch As I've said It's very unnecessary Oh it's a bit of a pain isn't it Fine Fine Okay Yeah Sorry about that Okay then I'll just have to do that then Well fine then Goodbye Bye
