Then would finance dev speaking How can I help Hi there I just recently moved and I need to change the address on my account I've been looking online I can't find any way to do that Can you direct me to where I need to go Yeah At the moment you you're not able to actually update the address online And the reason for that is because we need to check the ID just to make sure that obviously the address that you've moved to We need a utility bill or something like that So you're just going to have to go into the branch If you take your utility bill with you just as proof of your new address they'll be able to change that in the branch for you Okay that's fine All right Okay Thank you Bye bye
