Hall and Wood Finance Phil speaking Good afternoon I would like to change my address I've recently moved and I can't find where to do this on the Web site Yeah you can't do on the Web site Unfortunately you can only do it in the branch Sorry so I have to go into a branch to actually change my address Yes That seems a bit unnecessary Is there no way to do it online I don't drive and the local branch is quite far away and I simply have no time this week to do this It is It is there There's no other option apart from from going in person Unfortunately no there's not an option to do it online The reason you can't go over the phone is because we have to see your ID which is why you have to go in to the branch Well is there no way to take a photo and then put it online I mean it seems very unnecessary to just drive all the way you know especially with the computer computer nowadays Just take a photo and and send it in Yeah Yeah As I said unfortunately that's not something that we offer So if you want to change the address the only way you can do that is by going into the branch As I've said It's very unnecessary Well it's a bit of a pain isn't it Fine fine OK Yeah Sorry about that OK And well I'm just going to have to do that then Well fine then Goodbye Bye
