Hall and Wood Finance Dave speaking how can I help Hi there I just recently moved and I need to change the address on my account And I've been looking online I can't find any way to do that Can you direct me to where I need to go Yeah At the moment you you you're not able to actually update the address online The reason for that is because we need to check the identification just to make sure that obviously the address that you've moved to you know we need a utility bill or something like that Okay So you're just going to have to go into the branch if you take a utility bill with you just as proof of your new address they'll be able to change that in the branch for you OK that's fine Alright OK Thank you Bye Bye
