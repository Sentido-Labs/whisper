Paul, and with finance, Marie speaking, how can I help?
Yeah, I'm trying to make a transfer between some of my accounts.
Basically, I'm supposed to put the deposit down on a flat,
and I have to get this money from one account into the other
so I can pay out.
And I've gone online, and I can't get it to work,
and I've gone into the branch, and the queue is massive.
Like, it's ridiculous how long the queues are in there,
and I spoke to one of the agents in there,
and I asked them how long do you reckon
this queue is going to go down,
because there was like 20 people in front of me,
and I said, how long do you reckon it's going to be?
And she said it could be anywhere upward of half an hour,
which is, frankly, ridiculous.
So I just need to transfer some money from one account
to the other as soon as possible,
because I'm about to miss this deadline.
So is that something you can help me with?
Yeah, I can help you. Don't worry.
Yeah, it's because it's lunchtime.
The queues will be terrible.
Let me do that over the phone for you.
So did you say that both your accounts are with us?
Yeah.
Okay, I can do that. Don't worry.
Let me... So what's the first account number?
It's CF2976.
76, yes.
71.
Okay, I've got you here, David Roberts.
Yes.
Okay, fabulous.
And are you transferring to your current account?
Yeah, yes.
Yeah, so from the savings account to the current account,
I can see it.
That's brilliant.
How long is it? Sorry.
How long is it going to take for this payment to go to?
I can do it great for you now, sir.
So that's going to...
So once you process, it's going to be in my account
because, I mean, I tried to do this this morning,
like I say, online, and just the payment was failing.
And, you know, going into the queue, it was just...
The queues in there was... I mean...
I'm so sorry about that.
We're having a bit of a problem on our online service
at the moment, but I can put this through you straight away.
Just how much would you like to transfer?
It's £24,500.
Okay, £24,500.
And can you give me the sort code just for, obviously,
for safety purposes?
Yeah, it's 20, 60, 77.
That's brilliant. Okay.
So I'm just transferring now from your savings account
to your current account.
So that's £24,500 transferred over for you.
That's all done.
That's in there now.
That's in there. That's all done for you.
Oh.
That is...
I told you not to worry. It's all fine.
I know. It's just...
Thank you so much, because I was so panicked about that.
No problem. Absolutely fine.
I really appreciate you doing that.
So is that the quickest way to, you know,
in future, if I need to transfer money,
is it just easier to call up?
Yeah. Do you think so?
Yes, especially, like, I think just people forget that we're here.
Have you got the situation?
Yeah, it's a lot easier if you just ring in.
Yeah. Okay.
All right. Thank you so much for your help.
I really appreciate that.
No problem. Have a lovely day.
You too. Thank you. Take care.
Thank you now. Bye.
Bye.
