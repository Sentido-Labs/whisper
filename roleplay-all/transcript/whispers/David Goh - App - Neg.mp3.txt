I'm trying to download the app onto my phone but it keeps on freezing.
It comes up with a black screen and then the app just shuts itself down.
So the app, you've got it on the phone, you can see the icon.
Yeah, yeah, I can click on it and then it just goes to a black screen and then it just shuts itself down completely.
Right, and what phone are you using?
A Huawei phone.
Ah, okay.
Yeah, the app unfortunately is designed to be compatible with Huawei phones but we are finding that it currently only works with iOS and Android.
Some people are having issues with it on the Huawei phone.
Oh, that's so annoying. It says on the actual thing, like on the app store, that it's compatible with Huawei phones.
Yeah, yeah. As I say, it is designed to work with a Huawei phone but some users are having problems and it just, unfortunately, looks like you are one of the users who's having an issue.
We are trying to fix the problem but at the moment we don't have a result for that unfortunately.
So what am I supposed to do?
Have you got an iPad or anything like that?
I've got an iPad.
Oh, well, because that's Apple, that's iOS, you could download the banking app.
Yeah, but I don't carry around with me everywhere.
Is there nothing that you can do on a Huawei phone?
Not at the moment, no.
Oh, that's a pain.
Okay, fine.
Sorry about that.
No worries, okay, fine.
Thanks.
Bye.
Bye.
