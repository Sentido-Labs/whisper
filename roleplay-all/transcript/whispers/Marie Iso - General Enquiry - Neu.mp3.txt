Oh, hi. I know this might seem like a silly question, but obviously your phone lines close
at eight and obviously the branch is they also close in the evening. But if I want to
do something online, can I do that through the night? If I were to place a transaction
at 11 o'clock at night, does that then go through in the night? Or do I have to wait
for their opening hours with online? Oh, no, no. You can do that overnight. So if I do
something online, if I process a transaction online, it... Yeah, that should happen overnight
for you. Okay. All right, great. Okay, thank you for that.
Okay, bye. Bye.
