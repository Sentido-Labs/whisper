Lauren would finance Craig speaking how can I help Hi there I have broken my arm and I was wondering how I go about claiming on the insurance You see I've broken my right arm and it's my righting arm and I can't actually write anything So I don't know how I'm going to fill in a form Oh that does sound like a bit of a problem Yeah Oh well I'm so sorry to hear that Oh that's alright thank you Do you have a friend or a relative who might be able to help you fill in the form I do I do Is there no way would I have to send that off or where do I pick one up do I go online Well there's a few options for you so you could either pop into a branch and I mean this sounds like a silly thing to say but obviously you would need to sign the form but if you were to go into the branch if you are unable to do that you would be able to just take in some identification and they would be able to validate the form that way That's what I was thinking you see Yeah I think that might be the best option for you Alternatively you could do it online but again I think your best option at this point is to go into the branch have you got a friend who might be able to help you get down there Yeah that's fine I mean it's just my arm it is but I can drive down to the branch that's fine Yeah gosh it's so frustrating isn't it I broke my arm about two years ago and Oh it's annoying isn't it Yeah it's really annoying so So you were right in arm as well It was it was and you don't realise how many things you use your arm for you've suddenly lost it so I completely understand how you feel Yeah it's been a nightmare Yeah I completely understand Well I hope you feel better soon and yeah call back if you've got any problems if you have any problems getting down to the branch then just give us a call and we'll see if we can find another way to do that but don't worry we will absolutely get your claim in Brilliant thank you very much you've been very helpful Alright I hope you feel better soon Oh thank you Okay now bye Take care bye
