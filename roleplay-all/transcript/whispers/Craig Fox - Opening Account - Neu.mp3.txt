Pauline with Finance, Craig speaking, how can I help?
Good morning.
I wonder if you can help me, actually.
I'm looking to open an account, specifically not just for me,
but for myself and my son.
So we're joined to account, necessarily.
So basically, because I want to monitor his finances,
so I've heard that you can get a joined to account
between yourself and your son or daughter, for example.
Do you do that at all?
We do do joined to accounts, but how old is your son?
So he's 15.
Right.
Unfortunately, because in order to open a joined to account,
both account holders must be over 18,
so we wouldn't be able to offer you a joined to account
as your son is, unfortunately, under age.
Oh, OK.
Is there not an alternative?
I just basically want an account where
I can monitor his finances.
So just to keep an eye on him.
No, absolutely, absolutely.
What we could do, what we do have an account,
which is for people who are under 18, that can be opened.
If they're opened by both parties,
we can give you permission to be able to access that account,
and you could actually limit the access.
So you could control the spending limits.
You could also have the login details.
Those could be in your name, so that you
could have full access to that account and control
how much money is going in and also how much money is going out.
You can also decide where money can and can't be spent on the cards,
which I know a lot of people find quite useful.
I don't know if your son does gaming or anything like that,
but I know sometimes people can get into a bit of trouble
when their kids spend too much money on gaming websites
and things like that, so you can set all those kinds of limits.
Does that sound like something that could work for you?
Yes, and he could still access that as well then,
or is that just myself?
Yeah, absolutely, and we've also got a mobile phone app,
so he'd be able to access it on the mobile phone, as would you.
But you would ultimately have control over, as I say,
how much money is going in, how much money is going out.
Amazing.
Yeah, that sounds exactly what I want.
Yeah, okay. We do ask, if you're opening an account
just for the identification purposes,
for you to do that in branch.
Are you local to a branch? Do you know?
Yes, I've already got an account myself, actually.
Oh, great. Okay, brilliant.
So all you need to do is just pop into one of our branches,
and one of the agents will be more than happy to help you with that account.
Brilliant, that was great. Thank you very much.
All right, have a great day.
Okay, you too. Bye.
Bye.
