Hello, Hallam Wood, Bernadette speaking, how can I help you?
Oh, hi, I just have a question.
I have health insurance and travel insurance with you.
And I just wondered, do you do,
if I were to take out content insurance,
do I get, like currently I get a discount,
like I think it's 5% with the two packages,
does that apply if I do three,
if I add another insurance to that, does that count?
Yes, that does, you do get a discount,
so that would be an extra 10%.
Okay, so it goes up to 10 if I do the three packages.
That's the one?
Oh, that's quite good, isn't it?
Yeah, okay, and can I do that online or?
Yeah, you can do it online or you can come into the store,
come to the branch, just totally up to you.
Yeah, I think I'll do it online
because it's just a bit easier, isn't it,
than coming to the branch.
So those queues, you know, they can get quite long.
But all right, well, thanks for your help.
No worries, okay, bye.
Bye.
