Good afternoon, Hall and Wood Finance. Laura speaking, how can I help you?

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:09,080
Hi. I would like to add an overdraft facility to my account, please.

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:14,160
That's absolutely fine. And what is your account number and your account name?

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,120
CF. Mm-hmm.

5
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,600
2-1.

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,760
2-1.

7
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,480
4-5.

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,800
4-5.

9
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,600
7-8.

10
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,960
Fabulous, I can see the year. And what's the account name, please?

11
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,600
James Pinkham.

12
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,560
Fabulous. I can see you here, James.

13
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,800
That is absolutely fine.

14
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,920
What amount of overdraft would you like to actually put on your account?

15
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,600
Well, what's the best you can give me?

16
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:48,640
I mean, like, I need about 1,500 or something like that.

17
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,840
Is that OK?

18
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,000
Yeah, that's absolutely fine. 1,500.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,120
Actually, it's day and year because you've been with us for so long,

20
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,920
I can actually offer you a six-month interest-free period.

21
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,800
You're joking.

22
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,760
No, absolutely.

23
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,520
Just as a long-list tea kind of thing,

24
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,040
because you've been with us for quite a while now, haven't you?

25
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:06,640
Yeah.

26
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,560
We'd like to reward our existing customers.

27
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:13,160
So, yes, I can actually extend that overdraft for you

28
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,640
for a six-month interest-free period.

29
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:19,440
Well, that'd be fantastic if you could, yeah.

30
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,640
That'd be great.

31
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,040
Absolutely no problem. I'd love to do that for you.

32
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,800
So, that is all set up for you now to be able to use that.

33
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,080
If you just give it like an hour or two, just a vessel,

34
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:32,000
and then that will be there all for you.

35
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,600
That's brilliant. Thanks so much.

36
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,160
Thank you so much for that. I wasn't expecting that.

37
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,400
That's amazing.

38
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,120
No, it's a major day, haven't I?

39
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:40,960
No, like I said.

40
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,760
Well, have a lovely day. Anything else that you need from me?

41
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,560
No, that's all. Thank you. Thank you so much.

42
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,360
No worries. Have a lovely day and enjoy your overdraft.

43
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,080
Thank you. See you later.

44
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,080
No, bye. Bye.
