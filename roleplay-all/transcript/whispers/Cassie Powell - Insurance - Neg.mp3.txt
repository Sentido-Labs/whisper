Paul and Woodfinance, Cassie speaking.
Oh, hi.
I filed an insurance claim on my content insurance,
basically I had a break-in,
and I've been waiting for the check
for just over a week now,
and I was told that it would be with me,
but I've still not received it.
And I called up yesterday,
and the agent that I spoke to said
that it would be coming today.
She assured me that it would come today,
and it's still not arrived.
And what's your account number?
Is CF791277.
And name on the account?
Is Tony White.
Okay.
Yeah, I can see here that your check
has been sent out to you already,
so it should be there pretty soon,
probably in the next day or so.
Okay, this is so frustrating.
Yesterday when I called up, they said,
yep, the check has been sent,
you're definitely going to get it tomorrow,
and the post has been, and it's not here,
and now you're saying,
oh, it will be in the next couple of days.
Well, it has been sent out,
it usually takes about three working days,
but obviously, probably with Christmas,
it might take a little bit longer.
Yeah, I mean, all I can say it's been sent out,
that's what it says here on the system.
So you should...
No, there's no, so you can't...
I mean, you know, maybe it's got lost in the post,
so is there no way that you could send another check,
just in case, and then if the other check arrives,
you know, whichever one comes first, I'll cash that,
and then if another one arrives, I can just cancel it.
I can't do that, unfortunately.
It says here that it should be with you in the next few days.
If you still haven't received it in, say, a couple of weeks' time,
we can...
OK, but I mean, OK, yesterday they were saying it's one day,
and now you're saying a couple of weeks.
Well, I'm saying if it hasn't arrived in a couple of weeks, then...
But I just need...
