Hello Hi is that Tony Yes B King Who's this Hi there Mr White My name is Vicky I'm actually calling from Holland Wood Finance You spoke to one of my colleagues earlier about a check that you're waiting for Yes yeah I mean this has been going on for over a week now I was told that the check would arrive within a couple of days I think it's three working days I called up I was then told oh no your check's going to be with you the next day definitely And then I just called up and spoke to one of your employees there earlier as you know And they said oh it could be a couple of days Could be a couple of weeks And frankly I think the service is just disgusting I think it's ridiculous I've had a breakin I'm waiting for this money I can't afford to buy my kids their Christmas presents until I get this check And I'm just waiting on you And I'm finding it incredibly frustrating to be honest No I completely understand sir I just want to apologize for the conversation earlier We listened to the call Why do all the agents have different information That's what I want to know I think you were basically wrongly advised I'm so sorry about that So it seems that your check has actually we would assume got lost in the post It should have been with you by now which what we can do in this situation is send you out another check and then cancel the first one So obviously when the first one comes along we can just obviously cancel that one So what I have done is put another check in the post for you which you would receive in the next couple of days So yeah let me know when you receive that OK so how long did you say that check's going to take to arrive It should take a couple of days It's sent within first class So it should be there with you tomorrow but at the very most a couple of days Right OK And is that the best that you can offer at the moment That is the best that we can offer at the moment I'm afraid sir but just to apologize for the treatment that you had earlier And obviously with the postal service because it's Christmas it seems to be a bit all over the place at the moment But this should be with you ASAP OK All right OK Well thanks for ringing OK Let me know that you actually get that second check sir And obviously when the first one does come along it should be with you at some point then that will just be canceled And have a lovely Christmas And hopefully as I said this should be with you pretty soon And all your Christmas presents should be able to be bought Yeah well I hope so Yeah OK Thank you Thank you for ringing No worries OK Thank you very much sir OK Thank you very much Bye Narrow Bye Bye
