Good morning, Holland Wood Finance. Laura speaking, how can I help you?
Oh, hello. Yeah, sorry, I've got a question. You know, when you go to the shop with the
thing where you, you know, you put your card on?
Oh, the contact list.
Yeah, contact list, that's it.
Like, so you know that you can pay with, I think you can pay, like, for things that's
£30 with that.
Yes.
Can I make it so that I can pay for things, like, that are more expensive with the tap?
I'm afraid you can't. It's a £30 limit for all cards. Just obviously, if it got lost
or if it got stolen, it stops anyone from going over that amount. It's your own safety
lady.
So you can't, so I can't, like, increase the limit of that so that I could, like, if I
wanted to buy something for, sort of, 40 quid or 50 quid, I can't change that.
No, unfortunately not. As I said, it's for your own safety, but yes, it's a £30 limit
on each purchase.
Oh, okay. All right, thank you. Bye.
Bye.
