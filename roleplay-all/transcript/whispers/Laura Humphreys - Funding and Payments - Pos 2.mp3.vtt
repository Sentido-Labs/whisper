Good afternoon, Hall and Wood Finance. Laura speaking, how can I help you?

00:03.680 --> 00:09.080
Hi. I would like to add an overdraft facility to my account, please.

00:09.080 --> 00:14.160
That's absolutely fine. And what is your account number and your account name?

00:14.160 --> 00:16.120
CF. Mm-hmm.

00:16.120 --> 00:17.600
2-1.

00:17.600 --> 00:18.760
2-1.

00:18.760 --> 00:20.480
4-5.

00:20.480 --> 00:21.800
4-5.

00:21.800 --> 00:24.600
7-8.

00:24.600 --> 00:27.960
Fabulous, I can see the year. And what's the account name, please?

00:27.960 --> 00:30.600
James Pinkham.

00:30.600 --> 00:33.560
Fabulous. I can see you here, James.

00:33.560 --> 00:35.800
That is absolutely fine.

00:35.800 --> 00:39.920
What amount of overdraft would you like to actually put on your account?

00:39.920 --> 00:42.600
Well, what's the best you can give me?

00:42.600 --> 00:48.640
I mean, like, I need about 1,500 or something like that.

00:48.640 --> 00:49.840
Is that OK?

00:49.840 --> 00:52.000
Yeah, that's absolutely fine. 1,500.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.120
Actually, it's day and year because you've been with us for so long,

00:55.120 --> 00:58.920
I can actually offer you a six-month interest-free period.

00:58.920 --> 00:59.800
You're joking.

00:59.800 --> 01:01.760
No, absolutely.

01:01.760 --> 01:03.520
Just as a long-list tea kind of thing,

01:03.520 --> 01:06.040
because you've been with us for quite a while now, haven't you?

01:06.040 --> 01:06.640
Yeah.

01:06.640 --> 01:09.560
We'd like to reward our existing customers.

01:09.560 --> 01:13.160
So, yes, I can actually extend that overdraft for you

01:13.160 --> 01:15.640
for a six-month interest-free period.

01:15.640 --> 01:19.440
Well, that'd be fantastic if you could, yeah.

01:19.440 --> 01:20.640
That'd be great.

01:20.640 --> 01:23.040
Absolutely no problem. I'd love to do that for you.

01:23.040 --> 01:26.800
So, that is all set up for you now to be able to use that.

01:26.800 --> 01:29.080
If you just give it like an hour or two, just a vessel,

01:29.080 --> 01:32.000
and then that will be there all for you.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.600
That's brilliant. Thanks so much.

01:34.600 --> 01:37.160
Thank you so much for that. I wasn't expecting that.

01:37.160 --> 01:38.400
That's amazing.

01:38.400 --> 01:40.120
No, it's a major day, haven't I?

01:40.120 --> 01:40.960
No, like I said.

01:40.960 --> 01:43.760
Well, have a lovely day. Anything else that you need from me?

01:43.760 --> 01:45.560
No, that's all. Thank you. Thank you so much.

01:45.560 --> 01:49.360
No worries. Have a lovely day and enjoy your overdraft.

01:49.360 --> 01:51.080
Thank you. See you later.

01:51.080 --> 01:53.080
No, bye. Bye.
