Good afternoon, Holland Wood Finance, Bernadette here. How are you? Can I help you?
Yeah, I'm good. Thank you. How are you?
I'm good. Thank you.
Great. I just wanted to find out the opening hours for my local branch, actually,
and also to find out if they've got self-serve counters in there.
Okay. What is your local branch? Do you know?
It's Market Harbour.
Oh, fantastic. Okay, let me just have a look.
It's the one on the high street.
Oh, yes, I see here. Okay, so the opening hours are actually 8.30 to 5.30.
And I believe they do have self-serve counters.
We've got self-serve counters in most of our branches, not all at the moment,
so you should be fine with that.
Okay, great. And also, do they have one of those machines?
You know, like when you go into the supermarket,
when you've got all your sort of loose chains or your coppers and things,
like those coin counting machines, do they have those in there?
We do have one in each of our branches now, though.
Oh, great. Okay, brilliant. All right, thanks so much for your help.
No worries. Okay, thank you very much.
Bye. Bye.
