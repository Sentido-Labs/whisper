All in wood finance, Ash speaking, how can I help?
Yes, maybe you could help me.
I've just moved house and I need to change my address,
but I don't want to wait in the long queues in the branch.
I was wondering if I could do it over the phone.
Unfortunately, at the moment, the only way to do it is in the branch.
The reason for that is because we do need to see your identification.
We need to see a utility bill with the new address on.
Oh, it's such a long queue.
Yeah, I know, I'm so sorry about that.
Which branch is it that you're using?
Well, I'm near Newport on the Isle of Wight.
Oh, I've been to the Isle of Wight, yeah.
Oh, have you?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I went to, is it Sanddown?
Yes, that's near me, I know it will.
Oh, wow, yeah, I loved it there.
Oh, I'm glad you did, that's a good idea.
I had a great time.
Well, we've actually, so I take it you've been,
obviously you go to the Newport branch.
I don't know if you know, but we've actually opened a second branch in RIDE.
Oh, have you?
Yeah, it's brand new, we've got lots of self searches in there,
which makes it much quicker.
Yeah, a lot of the customers don't actually know about it yet.
Which is, I mean, it's good for you,
because it means that the queues right now,
I mean, they're minimal in the RIDE branch.
Oh, what's that, what's the name?
It's on Union Street, it says here.
Oh, fantastic, I need to go and see my sister down there anyway.
So it's absolutely fine, I could actually pop in there on the way.
Oh, brilliant, it says here it's got free parking there as well.
Oh, free park, but that's brilliant.
Yeah.
It's been very helpful, that works really well for me actually.
Yeah, or is there anything else I can help you with?
No, that's fantastic, I'll just pop along there.
Brilliant, all right, well have a great day.
You too, okay, thank you for being so helpful.
Not a problem, take care.
Bye now, bye.
