Well, I'm with Finance, Dave speaking, how can I help?
Hi there. I just recently moved and I need to change the address on my account.
I've been looking online, I can't find anywhere to do that.
Can you direct me to where I need to go?
Yeah, at the moment you're not able to actually update the address online
and the reason for that is because we need to check the identification
just to make sure that obviously the address that you've moved to,
we need a utility bill or something like that.
So you're just going to have to go into the branch.
If you take a utility bill with you just as proof of your new address
they'll be able to change that in the branch for you.
Okay, that's fine.
Alright, okay.
Thank you.
Bye.
