Pauline, would finance, Cassie speaking?
Hey, I know you guys have a problem with the app at the moment.
Can you give me any idea when that's going to be fixed?
We don't actually know at the moment,
but we're hoping that it will be fixed by tomorrow.
OK, is that OK?
So you're hoping that's not definite, no?
It's not definite, but we're hoping it be finished tomorrow.
OK.
All right, how likely do you think
it is that's actually going to happen?
Because, you know, I mean, this problem has been going on
for a really long time.
I can't give you a guarantee, sir.
All I know is what the information that they feed us,
and they've said that it should be done by tomorrow morning.
I mean, I've called like three times about this.
I mean, are other customers calling for that?
I can only apologize, sir.
We're doing our best here.
No, I appreciate that, but, I mean,
surely I can't be the only customer who's...
You can go on the website in the moment, sir,
as well as actually popping into one of our branches.
I know, but the website is not convenient.
It's actually pretty inconvenient, actually.
I find it pretty hard to navigate,
whereas the app, when it works, is great, but it's just...
Well, there's not much I'm afraid I can do, sir.
As I said, we only get fed the information that we do here,
and we get told that it will be done hopefully by tomorrow morning.
OK.
OK, I mean, I think that's not good enough,
but, OK, I guess there's nothing you or I could do, so, yeah.
Sorry about that, sir.
Is there anything else I can help you with today?
If you could fix the app, that would be great,
but I appreciate that you can't, so...
Yeah, sorry about that, sir.
All right, OK, yeah.
Thanks very much.
Bye now.
Bye.
