Hi there, Hall and Wood Finance. Marie speaking, how can I help?
Oh, hi. I need to remove a name from a joint account, please.
Okay. What is your name, please?
My name is Hugo Bolton.
Okay, and have you got your account number there, please, as well?
Yep, it's CF257981.
Okay. Yep, I can see you here.
With the joint account, we actually need permission from both people in order to close it.
So have you got the other person there with you?
No, the other person actually passed away.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
In which case, it's such a horrible thing to ask, but you would need to bring their death certificate to your local branch,
just as proof of identification and obviously the situation.
I'm afraid that's the only thing really that you can do.
I'm so sorry to ask you to do that.
No, no, no, it's okay. Okay. All right, I'll do that in the next day or two.
Okay. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
No, that's all. Thank you.
No worries. Have a lovely day.
You too.
Okay, goodbye.
Bye.
