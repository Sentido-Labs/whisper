Good afternoon, Hollandwood Finance, this is Laura speaking, how can I help you?

00:04.000 --> 00:07.000
Oh hello, I need to close an account please.

00:07.000 --> 00:15.000
Okay, no problems. Can I just ask why? Is there a problem with the account?

00:15.000 --> 00:24.000
It's actually my father's account, he just passed away so I'm just tying up all the accounts and things.

00:24.000 --> 00:32.000
Oh I'm so sorry to hear that, of course. What's your name? What was your father's name?

00:32.000 --> 00:38.000
My father's name was Pete Young, I've got the account number here if you need it.

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
Pete Young, oh yes please, what's the account number?

00:41.000 --> 01:01.000
It's CF098127. I've got him here Pete Young. Okay then I can close that for you, I'm so sorry.

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
Is there anything else that I can do today?

01:05.000 --> 01:11.000
What should I do? I think the balance is on empty, right?

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
There's nothing in it I'm afraid.

01:13.000 --> 01:20.000
There's nothing to tie up there. Anything else I can do for you today? That's all closed for you now.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
Okay, that's great, thank you so much for your help.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
Okay then, good bye.

01:26.000 --> 01:36.000
Thanks, bye.
