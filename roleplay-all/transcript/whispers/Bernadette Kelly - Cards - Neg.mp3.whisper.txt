Colin Woodfine has been a debt speaking How can I help Hi I have lost my card and so I need to just get that stopped or frozen or whatever and get a new one sent out please No problems What is your account number please CF719180 OK unnamed please Is David Johnson OK Mr Johnson Oh I'm actually sorry I'm actually not at home at the moment so I'm working away I'm actually working up in Scotland for the next few months I'm not going to be back on my home address So can I just change the address as well and get that sent to my current address We can't actually change the address that we send the card to The most I can do is I can offer to send it to your local branch I'm afraid that is there anyone that can send it to you from your home address perhaps or pick it up from your local branch and send it up to you But yeah OK fine fine that's fine OK so yeah I can send that card to you It'd be about 10 working days to your home address Is that all right I thought you said you could send it to a branch To your local branch I can send it to You mean you can't send it to a branch near where I am now No I'm afraid not sorry I just want to send it to your local branch and then you But how is that any good to me If you can't send it to my home address and I've just said I'm not going to be at my home address then why am I then going to go to the branch that's near my house rather than going You could have someone pick it up from the branch and then send it up to you to the address that you're staying at now But I could have someone pick it up from my home address and send it to me so that's stupid Well it's not stupid sir I'm just saying that those are two options you have Well if you can have it sent to my local branch why can't you have it sent to a branch that's local to me where I am now Well unfortunately this is not how it works We can send it to your local branch That seems like an absolutely ridiculous system because It's not ridiculous it's for your own kind of safety and Well how is it Because I could just pop into a branch with my ID and pick up the card It doesn't make any sense It's not my fault that you've lost your card sir Like so I can either kind of send it to you I'm saying it's not your fault It's not my fault that you've lost your card So I can get it sent to your home address And what so it's OK this is Sorry but your attitude is absolutely disgusting And this is I've been waiting in a queue I've been waiting in a queue for about 15 minutes to speak to you and I'm now having to deal with this attitude from you Normal queue waiting time sir is about 10 to 15 minutes I'm afraid Well that is absolutely ridiculous I'm sorry OK then Well do you want it sent to your home address or to you Do you know what Just forget it Forget it OK
