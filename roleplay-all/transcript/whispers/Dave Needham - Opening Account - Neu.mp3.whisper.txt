Hello Hollandwood Finance how can I help you Hi there so how long is it going to take over Christmas to like get basically I have applied for a credit card and it's taking it's taking a while to go through I'm wondering is it because of Christmas or you know just just how long does it usually take Okay usually they do take three to five working days but I'll be honest with the Christmas because of flight because of the bank holidays and that sometimes they do take a little bit longer so I'm so sorry about that but yeah just hang tight and it will get dealt with like everyone's going to be back at work on the 27th so if you if you can hold out till then you probably should get an answer definitely between Christmas and New Year That's quite annoying so how long did you say it was going to take So what day did you put the application in So it would have been Thursday Okay so Thursday it's 22nd 23rd 24th yeah so I think you probably should have your answer by the 28th 29th is that is that going to be okay Uh yeah it's going to have to do isn't it Yeah I'm so sorry about that it's just like you know it's lots of people applying for credit cards over Christmas and you know because because of the days off and that like things do get delayed a little bit um so I'm really sorry about that No that's fine don't worry okay Okay all right see you later Thank you bye Bye take care bye
