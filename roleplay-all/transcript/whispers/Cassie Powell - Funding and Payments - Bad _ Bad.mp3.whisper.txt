Hello this is Andrew Reese This is the fourth time I've called now I deposited money into my account a week ago I was told that it would take 24 hours to show up and it is still not there and I'm wondering what the hell is going on Alright what's your customer number CF297641 Sorry can you repeat that CF264971 Okay yeah I can see here It should be in there but it's not I'm afraid Yes I know that it's not in the account That's why I'm calling up When is it going to be in the account Because I'm getting very white because this is a large sum of money that I deposited and I put it in there a week ago That's my other account and it's not showing It shows that you put it in there It's just not saying it's just pending at the moment So we're just waiting on our end for it to clear Right but when is it going to clear because I need to start using the account I can't tell you I'm afraid so It should have cleared probably a while ago Yes I know it should have cleared a while ago but this is just absolutely ridiculous I shouldn't have to keep calling up to find out where my money is It's my money Well your money's here so you can see on the system It's not gone anywhere Yes but with all due respect you keep telling me oh yes we can see that you made the deposit But I don't have any proof of that Where's my proof Well I'm not very sure why it's taking so long to clear sir but it should be cleared Well can you find out Well I don't really know sir I'm afraid Well is there a manager there that I can speak to There isn't anyone here at the moment She just ran off on a lunch break Okay your manager's manager I'm afraid we only have the one manager on site sir Right well this is absolutely ridiculous okay because I'm being fobbed off I've been fobbed off every single time that I've called up and every time I ask this feature manager no one's She'll be back in like an hour sir if you want to ring up then Right if this is not sources I'm taking legal action because you are withholding my money
