Hello, Hall and Wood Finance, Phil speaking, how can I help?

00:03.760 --> 00:07.280
Hi there, I just want to see what my overdraft limit is actually.

00:07.280 --> 00:10.080
Um, yep, have you got the account number?

00:10.080 --> 00:12.560
Yeah, so it's 1-2.

00:12.560 --> 00:13.600
1-2.

00:13.600 --> 00:15.520
Oh, sorry, sorry, it's C-F.

00:15.520 --> 00:17.200
Oh, sorry, C-F.

00:17.200 --> 00:18.160
1-2.

00:18.160 --> 00:19.040
1-2.

00:19.040 --> 00:20.000
3-4.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.360
3-4.

00:21.360 --> 00:22.560
5-5.

00:22.560 --> 00:23.200
5-5.

00:24.640 --> 00:26.080
Okay, hold on one second.

00:26.080 --> 00:31.520
Is that Lisa Jennings?

00:31.520 --> 00:32.640
That's the one.

00:32.640 --> 00:35.360
Okay, great, and you just wanted to know what, sorry?

00:35.360 --> 00:37.600
Just how much my overdraft limit is actually.

00:38.800 --> 00:40.560
Okay, just hold on one sec.

00:42.080 --> 00:46.240
Okay, so you've got a limit of a thousand pounds,

00:46.240 --> 00:50.000
but then you've got 150 pounds of emergency borrowing.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.080
So basically if you go beyond that thousand pounds,

00:54.080 --> 00:56.560
you can borrow 150 in emergency,

00:56.560 --> 00:58.640
but you do get higher charges with it.

00:59.360 --> 01:00.800
That's okay, that's fine.

01:00.800 --> 01:01.920
Thank you very much.

01:01.920 --> 01:03.360
All right, see you later.

01:03.360 --> 01:04.080
Bye.

01:04.080 --> 01:28.080
Bye.
