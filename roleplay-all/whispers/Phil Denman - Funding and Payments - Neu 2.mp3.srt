Hello, Hall and Wood Finance, Phil speaking, how can I help?

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,280
Hi there, I just want to see what my overdraft limit is actually.

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,080
Um, yep, have you got the account number?

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,560
Yeah, so it's 1-2.

5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:13,600
1-2.

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,520
Oh, sorry, sorry, it's C-F.

7
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,200
Oh, sorry, C-F.

8
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,160
1-2.

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,040
1-2.

10
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,000
3-4.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,360
3-4.

12
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,560
5-5.

13
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,200
5-5.

14
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,080
Okay, hold on one second.

15
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:31,520
Is that Lisa Jennings?

16
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,640
That's the one.

17
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,360
Okay, great, and you just wanted to know what, sorry?

18
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,600
Just how much my overdraft limit is actually.

19
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,560
Okay, just hold on one sec.

20
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:46,240
Okay, so you've got a limit of a thousand pounds,

21
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:50,000
but then you've got 150 pounds of emergency borrowing.

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,080
So basically if you go beyond that thousand pounds,

23
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,560
you can borrow 150 in emergency,

24
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,640
but you do get higher charges with it.

25
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,800
That's okay, that's fine.

26
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,920
Thank you very much.

27
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,360
All right, see you later.

28
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,080
Bye.

29
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:28,080
Bye.
