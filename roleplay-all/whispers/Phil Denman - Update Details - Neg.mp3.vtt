Good afternoon. I would like to change my address. I've recently moved and I can't find where to do this on the website.

00:15.000 --> 00:21.000
Yeah, you can't do it on the website. Unfortunately, you can only do it in the branch.

00:21.000 --> 00:28.000
Sorry, so I have to go into a branch to actually change my address.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
Yes.

00:30.000 --> 00:40.000
That seems a bit unnecessary. Is there no way to do it online? I don't drive and the local branch is quite far away.

00:40.000 --> 00:51.000
I simply have no time this week to do this. Is there no other option apart from going in person?

00:51.000 --> 01:01.000
Unfortunately, no. There's not an option to do it online and the reason you can't do it over the phone is because we have to see your ID, which is why you have to go into the branch.

01:01.000 --> 01:16.000
Is there no way to take a photo and put it online? I mean, it seems very unnecessary to just drive all the way, especially with the computer nowadays, just take a photo and send it in.

01:16.000 --> 01:29.000
Yeah. As I said, unfortunately, that's not something that we offer, so if you want to change the address, the only way you can do that is by going into the branch, as I've said.

01:29.000 --> 01:42.000
Well, it's very unnecessary. It's a bit of a pain, isn't it? Fine.

01:42.000 --> 01:51.000
Yeah, sorry about that. Okay, then we'll have to do that then. We'll find then. Goodbye.

01:51.000 --> 02:15.000
Bye.
