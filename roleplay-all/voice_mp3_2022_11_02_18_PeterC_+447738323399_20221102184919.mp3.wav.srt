00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:37,340
of September 72. And just the postcode? PR26BB. And do you normally pay out of this alone

5
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:42,360

6
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,440
me as well, you're, as well as the telephone number I'm calling on, you've still got the

7
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:51,440
email address? Yes, yes. Of Mariella underscore, or sorry, Mariella33 underscore 3 at yahoo.com?

8
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,120
Yeah. And your appointment for the case is still the same as when we last spoke? Yeah.

9
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:00,680
Great, thank you for going to that with me. Just quickly, five calls are recorded between

10
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:06,120
the monopurpose office, but my colleague tried to contact you earlier today. Just really

11
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:13,280
to see if there's been any changes, any updates? Yeah, has been a bit. So two weeks ago, we

12
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:23,800
had an offer from the buyer for 143, which made both of us happy. And today after I spoke

13
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:30,840
with your colleague, they rang and said that they don't have enough money for the repair

14
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:44,480
and they took the offer away. Okay. So we are waiting. Yeah. In same time, my son, because

15
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:53,400
my ex husband decided he can let my son to buy the house. For me, it's too late because

16
00:01:53,400 --> 00:02:01,080
my credit card is destroyed. So I can't do anything. And hopefully my son can help to

17
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:09,440
buy the house. I don't know yet. He will speak with mortgage advisor, I think tomorrow because

18
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:18,640
he has already two houses and this will be like, I don't know. I don't know. Yeah. And

19
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:27,120
my ex husband, he has been to the hospital again because the anal fistula is still there.

20
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:40,360
So he's not well. He couldn't walk. He couldn't walk. He was not well. So it is a mess. Yeah,

21
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:46,480
this is the problem because if he would let us to buy the house from the beginning, everything

22
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:56,600
would be sorted now and we'll have no problem. But he refused. He was stubborn. And now it's

23
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:02,600
hard. So it's really maybe he will have a son then when there's appointment, whether

24
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:07,880
that's an option. Sorry. Maybe it's worth seeing what happens then with your son and

25
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:12,160
his appointment with the mortgage advisor. No, it's my son. It's my son. Yeah, yeah,

26
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:20,000
I think your son. Yeah, he is going tomorrow. Yeah. To speak with the mortgage advisor.

27
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:29,160
And after this, we have to decide what the mortgage advisor is telling us. Okay. If not,

28
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:37,800
we have another solution because I have to if I've been to the bank myself and the bank

29
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:47,120
said because the mortgage on the house is 52,000, they can if my husband will sign,

30
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:54,560
they can give me I don't know what they said something just to give me the 52,000. But

31
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:03,000
because what we have with you, yeah, we can't do this. So I have to find if I want to take

32
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:15,600
the house myself, I have to find around the 60,000 pounds, which won't be a problem because

33
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:21,760
I will have the money in the house. You know what I mean? So it's like a vicious circle.

34
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:30,800
I don't know where to start from. And because my credit history is destroyed. I can't. It's

35
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:36,320
not I mean, we've not kind of court judgment. We've not started any repossession activities.

36
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:42,280
We haven't defaulted it. It is it is showing an accurate reflection of your credit file. So,

37
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:46,920
you know, it will make things more difficult and costly, unfortunately. But it's not it's not,

38
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:54,080
you know, a lot of companies will have defaulted the account by the stage. We haven't done that.

39
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,360
So it's just a case of trying to get some resolution in this before things get worse really.

40
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:03,760
I don't know what to do. Do you want another week to see what happens with your son? Have

41
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:11,240
a think about options and then I would like another month because I would like to to see

42
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:17,560
what happened with my son. And because if the mortgage advisor will tell us so, you know,

43
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:24,360
you can ring any time actually for updates. But unfortunately, unfortunately, we'll move it for a

44
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:29,120
month. See what happens with everything that's going on. I don't think there's any point. Yeah,

45
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:35,880
believe me, Peter, I'm not sleeping. And you know, I tried everything. He he didn't want to

46
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:43,320
listen to me. I told him what to do. He refused to constantly refuse to do what what I said when

47
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:50,440
when I told him two years ago to do the remortgage. He refused. Yeah. When I told him to let me to buy

48
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:57,560
the house, he refused when. So I I don't know what to do more than this. No, no, it's it's

49
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,960
frustrating. I'm sure you know, it is. We don't want to pile on. Right. OK, well, I'll do it,

50
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:06,760
Mrs. Crocker. I'll hold the account for another month. OK, yeah. Hopefully, I will get some

51
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:13,480
resolution. Yeah. I'll keep the interest off the house. So the house because we never I was smart

52
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:20,040
enough. And when these people came for the house, I said, I'm not taking the house out from the

53
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:29,800
market. Yeah, yeah. So you can check with the agency if you want. You heard. And so now I have

54
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:40,760
the house on the market with two agencies, with you heard and with Kingswood. So when they said

55
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:51,880
this person came and at one point was another was another person from Kingswood. So we was happy

56
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:57,320
because you thought, oh, my God, they will start to beat. So maybe you can have more. Yeah. No.

57
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,680
The one which came from the other agency, he changed his mind after one day. Probably he

58
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:12,360
found another house. And this one informed me today. So I think even though estate agents

59
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:17,640
are not honest, because we asked, what can we do to secure the transaction?

60
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:23,640
Because I can't take the house out of the market if I don't secure the transaction. And they said,

61
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:30,040
I can't. So look like until I don't have the money in my bank account, I am not sure of anything.

62
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:37,480
Stupid law. Stupid law. Because in Romania, you have like a pre-contract where everybody saying

63
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:43,320
this is the deal and it will close. Doesn't matter what happened. Yes. Until I think the United

64
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:48,200
Kingdom laws until exchange of contracts, then then it's still pretty much open. There's a few.

65
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:55,160
I mean, it's it's a dog eat dog world, the world of estate agency. Yeah. Right. Well,

66
00:07:55,160 --> 00:08:00,040
let's let's see what happens. Let's hold it for a month then. And yeah, fingers crossed,

67
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,560
we'll have a little bit of movement down. But one of the options that you've discussed this evening

68
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:11,960
will get closure on us. Okay. Yeah. And in my time, he's not well. I had COVID and I had migraine.

69
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:19,960
Well, yeah. So look like anytime when I want, I don't understand what happened. I don't know what

70
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:25,560
what happened. Hopefully, it'll get there. No, it's been going on a while. So hopefully be some

71
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:32,200
resolution. You know, Peter, after everything will close, I definitely need to buy a bottle of wine

72
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:40,440
to you. No, no, no, it's probably real. There's rules and stuff and things like that. But you buy

73
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:47,480
yourself a bottle of wine. I'll be happy when it's all when it's all done with. But no, it will get

74
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:54,440
there. It is frustrating. No, really, I am. I am so grateful. And this is because your voice make

75
00:08:54,440 --> 00:09:01,480
me to feel calm. And he's not panicking. And because, you know, I don't want to speak with

76
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:06,360
other person because I don't want to explain all the story. But you understand, you know,

77
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:11,240
the story from the beginning. So we do have a few, you know, obviously, there's, there's other people

78
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:15,560
now we're, you know, we're, we're merging into becoming a bank now. So there's other colleagues

79
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:20,840
and such. It wasn't, I'll be honest with you, it wasn't even scheduled for a call today. It was

80
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:26,840
basically just because the, the other applicant obviously on the account, Mr. Papa, he still pays

81
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:33,720
direct ever for 20 pounds. So it was supposed to really, yeah, it's paid. But that's, that's just

82
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,640
why it's been scheduled in today, not really for a phone call. So one of my colleagues has just

83
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:41,880
called a little bit early. But I thought, you know, I may as well just fully finish the call

84
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:46,280
this month. Let's take a month. Hopefully there's been a little bit of movement with her, you know,

85
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:52,040
either your son where we stand with that or whether it will be a good, a good solution with my

86
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:57,000
Yeah, the interest stopped on the account. So the least it's not spiraling out of control,

87
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,560
which is the main thing. Okay. Yeah, so the settlement figure is what the settlement figure

88
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:08,200
would have been last month. How much is, how much is the figure? I'm saying all that and I don't

89
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:13,720
actually have it at the hand. Because if I have to, to borrow money, I need to know how much is in

90
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:18,200
total. Did you get one from us previously? Have you ever seen one? I don't. Yeah, I think it was

91
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:25,240
20 to 500 or something like this the last time when I've seen it. I think it's a little bit more

92
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:29,640
because it's got the payment holiday interest on the account. So, I mean, there's no interest going

93
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:44,920
on. No, but it would be just to know if I have to borrow because it's 52 on the mortgage. They told

94
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:52,120
me in the bank, you'd probably be looking around 25,200 because there's the actual balance. And

95
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:56,520
then there's the amount they stopped basically applying when customers took a payment holdout

96
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:01,320
on the COVID situation. They stopped any interest being applied. So, it's interest wouldn't go on

97
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:05,400
the interest, but then that's added up. I mean, do you want me to order you a settlement figure

98
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:10,520
so as you've got exactly what it is to the penny? And maybe they can email it through to you.

99
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:14,760
Yeah, yeah, it will be good because then I have the figure. You know what you need to cover in

100
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:20,680
your mortgage. You know what's essentially here. You know, don't, it'll come very formal as if you

101
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:27,240
are selling, just ignore a lot of the email, just it's got the exact figure for you. Yeah,

102
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:33,720
and then I know exactly how much money I have to borrow if... Yeah, if you do that. I mean,

103
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:37,880
I don't know maybe if there's mortgage supplies that can see if there is anything because I mean,

104
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:43,080
even with our balance and what you send the mortgages compared to what the house is worth,

105
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:50,360
you know, potentially it's still under 50% loaned to value. So, there may still be some options

106
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:55,560
there even with the adverse credit, but obviously it's more of a mortgage broker that needs to look

107
00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:00,280
at that. But let me get it through to you anyway. Do you have a good mortgage advisor?

108
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:04,280
Sorry? Do you know a good mortgage broker? Somebody who wants to...

109
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,360
We're not allowed to rent. We have to be very, very careful on that.

110
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:18,440
We're not allowed to give advice, but it's maybe... I asked two mortgage advisors and they said,

111
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:21,000
because my credit is not good, I can't do anything.

112
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:28,600
That's... I mean, we, with IDN and all, we've got accounts in our books that are in similar

113
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:33,240
worst arrears to what this is and we get settlement figures through, you know, it's...

114
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:38,600
A lot of it depends on variable factors, but maybe it's worth, I mean, you know, I don't know

115
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,920
if you accept, you know, maybe look around yourself on the internet and have a little,

116
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:47,720
you know, information gathering session before making... Or I mean, obviously if your son's got

117
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:51,320
a couple of houses, maybe, you know, I don't know what he does, whether he's got information.

118
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:56,520
No, tomorrow it's somebody who, one of my patients recommends, so hopefully...

119
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:00,680
Yeah. I always think word of mouth is better. You know, if you're doing it in your local area,

120
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:04,760
you know, if somebody's got their mortgage tied with them, sometimes it's better than just,

121
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:09,720
you know, picking anybody up. But we have to be very careful. We're not allowed to advise

122
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:16,280
or anything like that. It's, you know, not for us to do, but I'll get the settlement figure ordered.

123
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:21,080
You have to think about, obviously, options through. If you need anything from us, drop me

124
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:25,560
an email or, you know, give us a call, or if you know otherwise, we'll do the monthly cash

125
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:31,400
off at the start of December and see what we do. Okay. Lovely. Thank you so much.

126
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:47,400
No worries. Thank you so much, Peter. Thank you. Bye-bye.
