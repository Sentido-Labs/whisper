Hello. Hi, good evening. Is that Mrs. Mariella Kraken? Oh yes, Peter. Yeah. Hi, it's Peter

00:20.600 --> 00:25.360
of Oplahome. Is it okay to speak for a few moments? Yes, yes, yes. Yeah, can I just ask

00:25.360 --> 00:30.160
you to do the normal for me, your address and your date of birth, please? 5 Doney Road, 29

00:30.160 --> 00:37.340
of September 72. And just the postcode? PR26BB. And do you normally pay out of this alone

00:37.340 --> 00:42.360
schedule for weekly, monthly or fortnightly payments? Monthly, monthly. That's great. Just confirm

00:42.360 --> 00:45.440
me as well, you're, as well as the telephone number I'm calling on, you've still got the

00:45.440 --> 00:51.440
email address? Yes, yes. Of Mariella underscore, or sorry, Mariella33 underscore 3 at yahoo.com?

00:51.440 --> 00:56.120
Yeah. And your appointment for the case is still the same as when we last spoke? Yeah.

00:56.120 --> 01:00.680
Great, thank you for going to that with me. Just quickly, five calls are recorded between

01:00.680 --> 01:06.120
the monopurpose office, but my colleague tried to contact you earlier today. Just really

01:06.120 --> 01:13.280
to see if there's been any changes, any updates? Yeah, has been a bit. So two weeks ago, we

01:13.280 --> 01:23.800
had an offer from the buyer for 143, which made both of us happy. And today after I spoke

01:23.800 --> 01:30.840
with your colleague, they rang and said that they don't have enough money for the repair

01:30.840 --> 01:44.480
and they took the offer away. Okay. So we are waiting. Yeah. In same time, my son, because

01:44.480 --> 01:53.400
my ex husband decided he can let my son to buy the house. For me, it's too late because

01:53.400 --> 02:01.080
my credit card is destroyed. So I can't do anything. And hopefully my son can help to

02:01.080 --> 02:09.440
buy the house. I don't know yet. He will speak with mortgage advisor, I think tomorrow because

02:09.440 --> 02:18.640
he has already two houses and this will be like, I don't know. I don't know. Yeah. And

02:18.640 --> 02:27.120
my ex husband, he has been to the hospital again because the anal fistula is still there.

02:27.120 --> 02:40.360
So he's not well. He couldn't walk. He couldn't walk. He was not well. So it is a mess. Yeah,

02:40.360 --> 02:46.480
this is the problem because if he would let us to buy the house from the beginning, everything

02:46.480 --> 02:56.600
would be sorted now and we'll have no problem. But he refused. He was stubborn. And now it's

02:56.600 --> 03:02.600
hard. So it's really maybe he will have a son then when there's appointment, whether

03:02.600 --> 03:07.880
that's an option. Sorry. Maybe it's worth seeing what happens then with your son and

03:07.880 --> 03:12.160
his appointment with the mortgage advisor. No, it's my son. It's my son. Yeah, yeah,

03:12.160 --> 03:20.000
I think your son. Yeah, he is going tomorrow. Yeah. To speak with the mortgage advisor.

03:20.000 --> 03:29.160
And after this, we have to decide what the mortgage advisor is telling us. Okay. If not,

03:29.160 --> 03:37.800
we have another solution because I have to if I've been to the bank myself and the bank

03:37.800 --> 03:47.120
said because the mortgage on the house is 52,000, they can if my husband will sign,

03:47.120 --> 03:54.560
they can give me I don't know what they said something just to give me the 52,000. But

03:54.560 --> 04:03.000
because what we have with you, yeah, we can't do this. So I have to find if I want to take

04:03.000 --> 04:15.600
the house myself, I have to find around the 60,000 pounds, which won't be a problem because

04:15.600 --> 04:21.760
I will have the money in the house. You know what I mean? So it's like a vicious circle.

04:21.760 --> 04:30.800
I don't know where to start from. And because my credit history is destroyed. I can't. It's

04:30.800 --> 04:36.320
not I mean, we've not kind of court judgment. We've not started any repossession activities.

04:36.320 --> 04:42.280
We haven't defaulted it. It is it is showing an accurate reflection of your credit file. So,

04:42.280 --> 04:46.920
you know, it will make things more difficult and costly, unfortunately. But it's not it's not,

04:46.920 --> 04:54.080
you know, a lot of companies will have defaulted the account by the stage. We haven't done that.

04:54.080 --> 04:58.360
So it's just a case of trying to get some resolution in this before things get worse really.

04:58.360 --> 05:03.760
I don't know what to do. Do you want another week to see what happens with your son? Have

05:03.760 --> 05:11.240
a think about options and then I would like another month because I would like to to see

05:11.240 --> 05:17.560
what happened with my son. And because if the mortgage advisor will tell us so, you know,

05:17.560 --> 05:24.360
you can ring any time actually for updates. But unfortunately, unfortunately, we'll move it for a

05:24.360 --> 05:29.120
month. See what happens with everything that's going on. I don't think there's any point. Yeah,

05:29.120 --> 05:35.880
believe me, Peter, I'm not sleeping. And you know, I tried everything. He he didn't want to

05:35.880 --> 05:43.320
listen to me. I told him what to do. He refused to constantly refuse to do what what I said when

05:43.320 --> 05:50.440
when I told him two years ago to do the remortgage. He refused. Yeah. When I told him to let me to buy

05:50.440 --> 05:57.560
the house, he refused when. So I I don't know what to do more than this. No, no, it's it's

05:57.560 --> 06:01.960
frustrating. I'm sure you know, it is. We don't want to pile on. Right. OK, well, I'll do it,

06:01.960 --> 06:06.760
Mrs. Crocker. I'll hold the account for another month. OK, yeah. Hopefully, I will get some

06:06.760 --> 06:13.480
resolution. Yeah. I'll keep the interest off the house. So the house because we never I was smart

06:13.480 --> 06:20.040
enough. And when these people came for the house, I said, I'm not taking the house out from the

06:20.040 --> 06:29.800
market. Yeah, yeah. So you can check with the agency if you want. You heard. And so now I have

06:29.800 --> 06:40.760
the house on the market with two agencies, with you heard and with Kingswood. So when they said

06:40.760 --> 06:51.880
this person came and at one point was another was another person from Kingswood. So we was happy

06:51.880 --> 06:57.320
because you thought, oh, my God, they will start to beat. So maybe you can have more. Yeah. No.

07:00.360 --> 07:04.680
The one which came from the other agency, he changed his mind after one day. Probably he

07:04.680 --> 07:12.360
found another house. And this one informed me today. So I think even though estate agents

07:12.360 --> 07:17.640
are not honest, because we asked, what can we do to secure the transaction?

07:17.640 --> 07:23.640
Because I can't take the house out of the market if I don't secure the transaction. And they said,

07:23.640 --> 07:30.040
I can't. So look like until I don't have the money in my bank account, I am not sure of anything.

07:30.040 --> 07:37.480
Stupid law. Stupid law. Because in Romania, you have like a pre-contract where everybody saying

07:37.480 --> 07:43.320
this is the deal and it will close. Doesn't matter what happened. Yes. Until I think the United

07:43.320 --> 07:48.200
Kingdom laws until exchange of contracts, then then it's still pretty much open. There's a few.

07:48.200 --> 07:55.160
I mean, it's it's a dog eat dog world, the world of estate agency. Yeah. Right. Well,

07:55.160 --> 08:00.040
let's let's see what happens. Let's hold it for a month then. And yeah, fingers crossed,

08:00.040 --> 08:03.560
we'll have a little bit of movement down. But one of the options that you've discussed this evening

08:04.760 --> 08:11.960
will get closure on us. Okay. Yeah. And in my time, he's not well. I had COVID and I had migraine.

08:13.080 --> 08:19.960
Well, yeah. So look like anytime when I want, I don't understand what happened. I don't know what

08:19.960 --> 08:25.560
what happened. Hopefully, it'll get there. No, it's been going on a while. So hopefully be some

08:25.560 --> 08:32.200
resolution. You know, Peter, after everything will close, I definitely need to buy a bottle of wine

08:32.200 --> 08:40.440
to you. No, no, no, it's probably real. There's rules and stuff and things like that. But you buy

08:40.440 --> 08:47.480
yourself a bottle of wine. I'll be happy when it's all when it's all done with. But no, it will get

08:47.480 --> 08:54.440
there. It is frustrating. No, really, I am. I am so grateful. And this is because your voice make

08:54.440 --> 09:01.480
me to feel calm. And he's not panicking. And because, you know, I don't want to speak with

09:01.480 --> 09:06.360
other person because I don't want to explain all the story. But you understand, you know,

09:06.360 --> 09:11.240
the story from the beginning. So we do have a few, you know, obviously, there's, there's other people

09:11.240 --> 09:15.560
now we're, you know, we're, we're merging into becoming a bank now. So there's other colleagues

09:15.560 --> 09:20.840
and such. It wasn't, I'll be honest with you, it wasn't even scheduled for a call today. It was

09:20.840 --> 09:26.840
basically just because the, the other applicant obviously on the account, Mr. Papa, he still pays

09:26.840 --> 09:33.720
direct ever for 20 pounds. So it was supposed to really, yeah, it's paid. But that's, that's just

09:33.720 --> 09:37.640
why it's been scheduled in today, not really for a phone call. So one of my colleagues has just

09:37.640 --> 09:41.880
called a little bit early. But I thought, you know, I may as well just fully finish the call

09:41.880 --> 09:46.280
this month. Let's take a month. Hopefully there's been a little bit of movement with her, you know,

09:46.280 --> 09:52.040
either your son where we stand with that or whether it will be a good, a good solution with my

09:52.040 --> 09:57.000
Yeah, the interest stopped on the account. So the least it's not spiraling out of control,

09:57.000 --> 10:01.560
which is the main thing. Okay. Yeah, so the settlement figure is what the settlement figure

10:01.560 --> 10:08.200
would have been last month. How much is, how much is the figure? I'm saying all that and I don't

10:08.200 --> 10:13.720
actually have it at the hand. Because if I have to, to borrow money, I need to know how much is in

10:13.720 --> 10:18.200
total. Did you get one from us previously? Have you ever seen one? I don't. Yeah, I think it was

10:18.200 --> 10:25.240
20 to 500 or something like this the last time when I've seen it. I think it's a little bit more

10:25.240 --> 10:29.640
because it's got the payment holiday interest on the account. So, I mean, there's no interest going

10:29.640 --> 10:44.920
on. No, but it would be just to know if I have to borrow because it's 52 on the mortgage. They told

10:44.920 --> 10:52.120
me in the bank, you'd probably be looking around 25,200 because there's the actual balance. And

10:52.120 --> 10:56.520
then there's the amount they stopped basically applying when customers took a payment holdout

10:56.520 --> 11:01.320
on the COVID situation. They stopped any interest being applied. So, it's interest wouldn't go on

11:01.320 --> 11:05.400
the interest, but then that's added up. I mean, do you want me to order you a settlement figure

11:05.400 --> 11:10.520
so as you've got exactly what it is to the penny? And maybe they can email it through to you.

11:10.520 --> 11:14.760
Yeah, yeah, it will be good because then I have the figure. You know what you need to cover in

11:14.760 --> 11:20.680
your mortgage. You know what's essentially here. You know, don't, it'll come very formal as if you

11:20.680 --> 11:27.240
are selling, just ignore a lot of the email, just it's got the exact figure for you. Yeah,

11:27.240 --> 11:33.720
and then I know exactly how much money I have to borrow if... Yeah, if you do that. I mean,

11:34.520 --> 11:37.880
I don't know maybe if there's mortgage supplies that can see if there is anything because I mean,

11:37.880 --> 11:43.080
even with our balance and what you send the mortgages compared to what the house is worth,

11:43.080 --> 11:50.360
you know, potentially it's still under 50% loaned to value. So, there may still be some options

11:50.360 --> 11:55.560
there even with the adverse credit, but obviously it's more of a mortgage broker that needs to look

11:55.560 --> 12:00.280
at that. But let me get it through to you anyway. Do you have a good mortgage advisor?

12:00.280 --> 12:04.280
Sorry? Do you know a good mortgage broker? Somebody who wants to...

12:05.400 --> 12:08.360
We're not allowed to rent. We have to be very, very careful on that.

12:10.280 --> 12:18.440
We're not allowed to give advice, but it's maybe... I asked two mortgage advisors and they said,

12:18.440 --> 12:21.000
because my credit is not good, I can't do anything.

12:23.240 --> 12:28.600
That's... I mean, we, with IDN and all, we've got accounts in our books that are in similar

12:28.600 --> 12:33.240
worst arrears to what this is and we get settlement figures through, you know, it's...

12:33.800 --> 12:38.600
A lot of it depends on variable factors, but maybe it's worth, I mean, you know, I don't know

12:39.400 --> 12:42.920
if you accept, you know, maybe look around yourself on the internet and have a little,

12:43.480 --> 12:47.720
you know, information gathering session before making... Or I mean, obviously if your son's got

12:47.720 --> 12:51.320
a couple of houses, maybe, you know, I don't know what he does, whether he's got information.

12:51.320 --> 12:56.520
No, tomorrow it's somebody who, one of my patients recommends, so hopefully...

12:56.520 --> 13:00.680
Yeah. I always think word of mouth is better. You know, if you're doing it in your local area,

13:00.680 --> 13:04.760
you know, if somebody's got their mortgage tied with them, sometimes it's better than just,

13:04.760 --> 13:09.720
you know, picking anybody up. But we have to be very careful. We're not allowed to advise

13:09.720 --> 13:16.280
or anything like that. It's, you know, not for us to do, but I'll get the settlement figure ordered.

13:16.280 --> 13:21.080
You have to think about, obviously, options through. If you need anything from us, drop me

13:21.080 --> 13:25.560
an email or, you know, give us a call, or if you know otherwise, we'll do the monthly cash

13:25.560 --> 13:31.400
off at the start of December and see what we do. Okay. Lovely. Thank you so much.

13:31.400 --> 13:47.400
No worries. Thank you so much, Peter. Thank you. Bye-bye.
